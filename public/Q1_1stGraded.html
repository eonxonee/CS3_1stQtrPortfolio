Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.<br>
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.<br>
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
Ooh, black and yellow!<br>
Let's shake it up a little.<br>
Barry! Breakfast is ready!<br>
Coming!<br>
Hang on a second.<br>
Hello?<br>
Barry?<br>
Adam?<br>
Can you believe this is happening?<br>
I can't.<br>
I'll pick you up.<br>
Looking sharp.<br>
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.<br>
Sorry. I'm excited.<br>
Here's the graduate.<br>
We're very proud of you, son.<br>
A perfect report card, all B's.<br>
Very proud.<br>
Ma! I got a thing going here.<br>
You got lint on your fuzz.<br>
Ow! That's me!<br>
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.<br>
Bye!<br>
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!<br>
Hey, Adam.<br>
Hey, Barry.<br>
Is that fuzz gel?<br>
A little. Special day, graduation.<br>
Never thought I'd make it.<br>
Three days grade school, three days high school.<br>
Those were awkward.<br>
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.<br>
You did come back different.<br>
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.<br>
Hear about Frankie?<br>
Yeah.<br>
You going to the funeral?<br>
No, I'm not going.<br>
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.<br>
Don't waste it on a squirrel.<br>
Such a hothead.<br>
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.<br>
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.<br>
That's why we don't need vacations.<br>
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.<br>
Well, Adam, today we are men.<br>
We are!<br>
Bee-men.<br>
Amen!<br>
Hallelujah!<br>
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,<br>
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.<br>
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.<br>
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!<br>
Will we pick our job today?<br>
I heard it's just orientation.<br>
Heads up! Here we go.<br>
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.<br>
Wonder what it'll be like?<br>
A little scary.<br>
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.<br>
This is it!<br>
Wow.<br>
Wow.<br>
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.<br>
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.<br>
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!<br>
That girl was hot.<br>
She's my cousin!<br>
She is?<br>
Yes, we're all cousins.<br>
Right. You're right.<br>
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.<br>
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.<br>
What do you think he makes?<br>
Not enough.<br>
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.<br>
What does that do?<br>
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.<br>
Saves us millions.<br>
Can anyone work on the Krelman?<br>
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.<br>
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.<br>
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.<br>
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.<br>
What's the difference?<br>
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.<br>
So you'll just work us to death?<br>
We'll sure try.<br>
Wow! That blew my mind!<br>
"What's the difference?"<br>
How can you say that?<br>
One job forever?<br>
That's an insane choice to have to make.<br>
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.<br>
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?<br>
Why would you question anything? We're bees.<br>
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.<br>
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?<br>
Like what? Give me one example.<br>
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.<br>
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.<br>
Wait a second. Check it out.<br>
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!<br>
Wow.<br>
I've never seen them this close.<br>
They know what it's like outside The Hive.<br>
Yeah, but some don't come back.<br>
Hey, Jocks!<br>
Hi, Jocks!<br>
You guys did great!<br>
You're monsters!<br>
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!<br>
I wonder where they were.<br>
I don't know.<br>
Their day's not planned.<br>
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.<br>
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.<br>
Right.<br>
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.<br>
It's just a status symbol.<br>
Bees make too much of it.<br>
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.<br>
Those ladies?<br>
Aren't they our cousins too?<br>
Distant. Distant.<br>
Look at these two.<br>
Couple of Hive Harrys.<br>
Let's have fun with them.<br>
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.<br>
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!<br>
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!<br>
Oh, my!<br>
I never thought I'd knock him out.<br>
What were you doing during this?<br>
Trying to alert the authorities.<br>
I can autograph that.<br>
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?<br>
Yeah. Gusty.<br>
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.<br>
Six miles, huh?<br>
Barry!<br>
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.<br>
Maybe I am.<br>
You are not!<br>
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.<br>
What do you think, buzzy-boy?<br>
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.<br>
Hey, Honex!<br>
Dad, you surprised me.<br>
You decide what you're interested in?<br>
Well, there's a lot of choices.<br>
But you only get one.<br>
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?<br>
Son, let me tell you about stirring.<br>
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.<br>
You get yourself into a rhythm.<br>
It's a beautiful thing.<br>
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,<br>
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.<br>
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?<br>
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.<br>
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!<br>
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.<br>
I'm not trying to be funny.<br>
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!<br>
You're gonna be a stirrer?<br>
No one's listening to me!<br>
Wait till you see the sticks I have.<br>
I could say anything right now.<br>
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!<br>
Let's open some honey and celebrate!<br>
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!<br>
I'm so proud.<br>
We're starting work today!<br>
Today's the day.<br>
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.<br>
Yeah, right.<br>
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...<br>
Is it still available?<br>
Hang on. Two left!<br>
One of them's yours! Congratulations!<br>
Step to the side.<br>
What'd you get?<br>
Picking crud out. Stellar!<br>
Wow!<br>
Couple of newbies?<br>
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!<br>
Make your choice.<br>
You want to go first?<br>
No, you go.<br>
Oh, my. What's available?<br>
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.<br>
Any chance of getting the Krelman?<br>
Sure, you're on.<br>
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.<br>
Wax monkey's always open.<br>
The Krelman opened up again.<br>
What happened?<br>
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.<br>
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.<br>
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!<br>
Oh, this is so hard!<br>
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.<br>
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?<br>
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...<br>
What happened to you?<br>
Where are you?<br>
I'm going out.<br>
Out? Out where?<br>
Out there.<br>
Oh, no!<br>
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.<br>
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?<br>
Another call coming in.<br>
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.<br>
Hey, guys.<br>
Look at that.<br>
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?<br>
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.<br>
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.<br>
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?<br>
Sign here, here. Just initial that.<br>
Thank you.<br>
OK.<br>
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.<br>
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.<br>
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.<br>
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!<br>
That's awful.<br>
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!<br>
All right, launch positions!<br>
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!<br>
Black and yellow!<br>
Hello!<br>
You ready for this, hot shot?<br>
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.<br>
Wind, check.<br>
Antennae, check.<br>
Nectar pack, check.<br>
Wings, check.<br>
Stinger, check.<br>
Scared out of my shorts, check.<br>
OK, ladies,<br>
let's move it out!<br>
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!<br>
All of you, drain those flowers!<br>
Wow! I'm out!<br>
I can't believe I'm out!<br>
So blue.<br>
I feel so fast and free!<br>
Box kite!<br>
Wow!<br>
Flowers!<br>
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.<br>
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.<br>
Roses!<br>
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.<br>
Stand to the side, kid.<br>
It's got a bit of a kick.<br>
That is one nectar collector!<br>
Ever see pollination up close?<br>
No, sir.<br>
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.<br>
See that? It's a little bit of magic.<br>
That's amazing. Why do we do that?<br>
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.<br>
Cool.<br>
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?<br>
Copy that visual.<br>
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.<br>
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?<br>
Affirmative.<br>
That was on the line!<br>
This is the coolest. What is it?<br>
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.<br>
It smells good.<br>
Not like a flower, but I like it.<br>
Yeah, fuzzy.<br>
Chemical-y.<br>
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.<br>
My sweet lord of bees!<br>
Candy-brain, get off there!<br>
Problem!<br>
Guys!<br>
This could be bad.<br>
Affirmative.<br>
Very close.<br>
Gonna hurt.<br>
Mama's little boy.<br>
You are way out of position, rookie!<br>
Coming in at you like a missile!<br>
Help me!<br>
I don't think these are flowers.<br>
Should we tell him?<br>
I think he knows.<br>
What is this?!<br>
Match point!<br>
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!<br>
Yowser!<br>
Gross.<br>
There's a bee in the car!<br>
Do something!<br>
I'm driving!<br>
Hi, bee.<br>
He's back here!<br>
He's going to sting me!<br>
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!<br>
He blinked!<br>
Spray him, Granny!<br>
What are you doing?!<br>
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.<br>
I gotta get home.<br>
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.<br>
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!<br>
Ken, could you close the window please?<br>
Ken, could you close the window please?<br>
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.<br>
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.<br>
What was that?<br>
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!<br>
That is diabolical.<br>
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.<br>
What's number one? Star Wars?<br>
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.<br>
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.<br>
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.<br>
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.<br>
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.<br>
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.<br>
Wait! Stop! Bee!<br>
Stand back. These are winter boots.<br>
Wait!<br>
Don't kill him!<br>
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!<br>
Why does his life have less value than yours?<br>
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?<br>
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.<br>
My brochure!<br>
There you go, little guy.<br>
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.<br>
Put that on your resume brochure.<br>
My whole face could puff up.<br>
Make it one of your special skills.<br>
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.<br>
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.<br>
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?<br>
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.<br>
You could put carob chips on there.<br>
Bye.<br>
Supposed to be less calories.<br>
Bye.<br>
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.<br>
All right, here it goes.<br>
Nah.<br>
What would I say?<br>
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.<br>
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.<br>
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!<br>
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.<br>
How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.<br>
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!<br>
Hi!<br>
I'm sorry. You're talking.<br>
Yes, I know.<br>
You're talking!<br>
I'm so sorry.<br>
No, it's OK. It's fine.<br>
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.<br>
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.<br>
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!<br>
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.<br>
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.<br>
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.<br>
Yeah.<br>
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!<br>
I just want to say I'm grateful.<br>
I'll leave now.<br>
Wait! How did you learn to do that?<br>
What?<br>
The talking thing.<br>
Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.<br>
That's very funny.<br>
Yeah.<br>
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.<br>
Anyway... Can I... get you something?<br>
Like what?<br>
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?<br>
I don't want to put you out.<br>
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.<br>
It's just coffee.<br>
I hate to impose.<br>
Don't be ridiculous!<br>
Actually, I would love a cup.<br>
Hey, you want rum cake?<br>
I shouldn't.<br>
Have some.<br>
No, I can't.<br>
Come on!<br>
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.<br>
Where?<br>
These stripes don't help.<br>
You look great!<br>
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.<br>
Are you all right?<br>
No.<br>
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.<br>
He finally gets there.<br>
He runs up the steps into the church.<br>
The wedding is on.<br>
And he says, "Watermelon?<br>
I thought you said Guatemalan.<br>
Why would I marry a watermelon?"<br>
Is that a bee joke?<br>
That's the kind of stuff we do.<br>
Yeah, different.<br>
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?<br>
About work? I don't know.<br>
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.<br>
I know how you feel.<br>
You do?<br>
Sure.<br>
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.<br>
Really?<br>
My only interest is flowers.<br>
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.<br>
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?<br>
You're in Sheep Meadow!<br>
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!<br>
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.<br>
Why do girls put rings on their toes?<br>
Why not?<br>
It's like putting a hat on your knee.<br>
Maybe I'll try that.<br>
You all right, ma'am?<br>
Oh, yeah. Fine.<br>
Just having two cups of coffee!<br>
Anyway, this has been great.<br>
Thanks for the coffee.<br>
Yeah, it's no trouble.<br>
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.<br>
Are you...?<br>
Can I take a piece of this with me?<br>
Sure! Here, have a crumb.<br>
Thanks!<br>
Yeah.<br>
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.<br>
OK, Barry.<br>
And thank you so much again... for before.<br>
Oh, that? That was nothing.<br>
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...<br>
This can't possibly work.<br>
He's all set to go.<br>
We may as well try it.<br>
OK, Dave, pull the chute.<br>
Sounds amazing.<br>
It was amazing!<br>
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.<br>
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!<br>
Giant, scary humans!<br>
What were they like?<br>
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.<br>
They eat crazy giant things.<br>
They drive crazy.<br>
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?<br>
Some of them. But some of them don't.<br>
How'd you get back?<br>
Poodle.<br>
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.<br>
You had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.<br>
Well...<br>
Well?<br>
Well, I met someone.<br>
You did? Was she Bee-ish?<br>
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!<br>
No, no, no, not a wasp.<br>
Spider?<br>
I'm not attracted to spiders.<br>
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.<br>
So who is she?<br>
She's... human.<br>
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.<br>
Her name's Vanessa.<br>
Oh, boy.<br>
She's so nice. And she's a florist!<br>
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!<br>
We're not dating.<br>
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!<br>
She saved my life! And she understands me.<br>
This is over!<br>
Eat this.<br>
This is not over! What was that?<br>
They call it a crumb.<br>
It was so stingin' stripey!<br>
And that's not what they eat.<br>
That's what falls off what they eat!<br>
You know what a Cinnabon is?<br>
No.<br>
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...<br>
Sit down!<br>
...really hot!<br>
Listen to me!<br>
We are not them! We're us.<br>
There's us and there's them!<br>
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?<br>
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!<br>
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!<br>
Thinking bee.<br>
Thinking bee.<br>
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br>
There he is. He's in the pool.<br>
You know what your problem is, Barry?<br>
I gotta start thinking bee?<br>
How much longer will this go on?<br>
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?<br>
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.<br>
What life? You have no life!<br>
You have no job. You're barely a bee!<br>
Would it kill you to make a little honey?<br>
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.<br>
Martin, would you talk to him?<br>
Barry, I'm talking to you!<br>
You coming?<br>
Got everything?<br>
All set!<br>
Go ahead. I'll catch up.<br>
Don't be too long.<br>
Watch this!<br>
Vanessa!<br>
We're still here.<br>
I told you not to yell at him.<br>
He doesn't respond to yelling!<br>
Then why yell at me?<br>
Because you don't listen!<br>
I'm not listening to this.<br>
Sorry, I've gotta go.<br>
Where are you going?<br>
I'm meeting a friend.<br>
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?<br>
Bye.<br>
I just hope she's Bee-ish.<br>
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?<br>
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!<br>
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.<br>
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?<br>
No. All right, I've got one.<br>
How come you don't fly everywhere?<br>
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.<br>
