<h1>Topics We Discussed In Class That I Know Very Well</h1>
1. <p>HTML/Markdown - Using HTML and Markdown is something I learned early. I can easily write headings, lists, and links using both.</p>
2. <p>Javascript Syntax - I understand how to write basic Javascript code correctly. I can spot errors if the syntax is wrong.</p>  
3. <p>Control Structures - I know how if-else statements work in deciding what the program should do, and I can use them to make programs do differents catered to specific conditions. </p>
4. <p>Variables - I know how to declare variables and store values in them, as well as how to change or modify when needed.</p>
5. <p>Key Javascript Operations - I can do basic math and string operations in Javascript. I know how to use operators like +, -, *, and / to calculate results.</p>

<h1>Topics I Know and Can Describe But Need Further Practice/Discussion</h1>
1. <p>Arrays - These  are used to store many values in one variable. I still need practice using them to add, remove, or access elements.</p>
2. <p>Readline - I do not get how the process works and what the code should look like. I will need more research and examples as well as explanations.</p>
3. <p>Functions - I know that functions are blocks of code that can be reused. Calling them and how to inputs values in correctly is where I need more practice.</p>
4. <p>While Loops - While loops keep running until a condition is false. I get confused when it involves other kinds of loops or arrays and functions.</p>

<h1>Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.</h1>
<p>My plan is to practice writing small codes every day that use arrays, functions, and loops. I will review examples from class and try to change them to see how they work. I will also ask questions in class or from my classmates if I do not understand something. Watching short tutorials online can also help me see more examples. And lastly, I will test my code often so I can learn from mistakes and improve.</p>  

<h1>In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?</h1>
<p>Two activities that were effective were coding exercises where we solved small problems because they helped me practice directly, and group discussions because I learned from classmatesâ€™ ideas. Two activities that were not effective were long lectures without examples because they were hard to follow, and copying notes from the board because it did not help me understand the actual coding process.</p>
